# Scalable Disk Monitoring Solution for AWS Multi-Account Environment

## Executive Summary

This solution provides a comprehensive, scalable disk monitoring system for AWS multi-account environments using Ansible for orchestration, AWS native services for data collection and aggregation, and secure cross-account access management. The architecture leverages AWS CloudWatch for metrics collection, AWS Systems Manager for agent deployment, and a centralized monitoring account for data aggregation and alerting.

## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Components

1. **Central Monitoring Account**: Hub for data aggregation, dashboards, and alerting
2. **Cross-Account IAM Roles**: Secure access management across multiple AWS accounts
3. **Ansible Control Node**: Orchestrates deployment and configuration management
4. **AWS Systems Manager**: Agent deployment and patch management
5. **CloudWatch**: Metrics collection, custom metrics, and alerting
6. **AWS Config**: Resource discovery and compliance tracking
7. **Amazon SNS**: Alert notifications and escalation

### Key Design Principles

- **Security First**: No hardcoded credentials, least privilege access, encrypted data transmission
- **Scalability**: Auto-discovery of new instances, horizontal scaling of monitoring components
- **Cost Optimization**: Leverages AWS native services to minimize operational overhead
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment with failover capabilities
- **Compliance**: Audit trails and compliance reporting built-in

## Detailed Architecture

### 1. Access Management & Security

#### Cross-Account IAM Strategy
```
Central Monitoring Account (Account A)
├── MonitoringRole (assumed by Ansible)
├── CrossAccountAssumeRole (can assume roles in target accounts)
└── CloudWatchCentralRole (aggregates metrics)

Target Accounts (Account B, C, D...)
├── MonitoredAccountRole (assumed by Central Account)
├── EC2MonitoringRole (attached to EC2 instances)
└── SystemsManagerRole (for agent management)
```

#### Security Features
- **IAM Roles**: No access keys, only temporary credentials
- **MFA Enforcement**: Multi-factor authentication for human access
- **VPC Endpoints**: All traffic stays within AWS backbone
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Audit Logging**: All actions logged to CloudTrail

### 2. Data Collection Strategy

#### Primary Collection Methods
1. **CloudWatch Agent**: Detailed disk metrics with custom namespaces
2. **Systems Manager Inventory**: Resource discovery and metadata
3. **AWS Config**: Configuration changes and compliance
4. **Custom Scripts**: Specialized metrics via Ansible playbooks

#### Metrics Collected
- Disk utilization percentage
- Available disk space (GB)
- Disk I/O metrics
- Inode utilization
- Historical growth trends
- Application-specific disk usage

### 3. Scalability Features

#### Auto-Discovery Mechanisms
- **AWS Config Rules**: Automatically discover new EC2 instances
- **EventBridge Integration**: Real-time notifications of new resources
- **Ansible Dynamic Inventory**: Automatically includes new instances in playbooks
- **Tags-Based Grouping**: Organize monitoring by environment, application, team

#### Horizontal Scaling
- **Regional Deployment**: Monitor instances across multiple AWS regions
- **Account Federation**: Easy addition of new AWS accounts
- **Micro-services Architecture**: Independent scaling of monitoring components
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis cache for frequently accessed metrics

## Cost Analysis

### Monthly Estimated Costs (1000 instances)
- CloudWatch Agent: $150
- Custom Metrics: $300
- Dashboard & Alarms: $50
- Data Transfer: $100
- Systems Manager: $0 (included)
- **Total: ~$600/month**

### Cost Optimization Strategies
- Use CloudWatch Logs Insights for ad-hoc queries
- Implement metric filters to reduce noise
- Use reserved capacity for predictable workloads
- Archive old metrics to S3 Glacier

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Temporary Credentials**: No long-lived access keys
- **Cross-Account Boundaries**: Proper isolation between accounts
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all access and changes

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted using AWS KMS
- **Network Security**: VPC endpoints and security groups
- **Compliance**: SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA ready architecture
- **Backup Strategy**: Cross-region backup of configuration

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Alert Categories
1. **Critical**: >95% disk usage, immediate action required
2. **Warning**: >85% disk usage, plan capacity increase
3. **Information**: Growth trends, capacity planning
4. **Security**: Unauthorized access attempts, configuration changes

### Escalation Matrix
```
Level 1: Automated remediation (if safe)
Level 2: On-call engineer notification
Level 3: Manager escalation
Level 4: Executive notification
```

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Configuration as Code (stored in Git)
- Cross-region replication of critical data
- Automated recovery procedures
- Regular disaster recovery testing

### Recovery Time Objectives
- **RTO**: 15 minutes for monitoring restoration
- **RPO**: 5 minutes maximum data loss
- **MTTR**: 30 minutes average resolution time

## Future Enhancements

### Roadmap (Next 6 months)
1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Predictive failure analysis
2. **Multi-Cloud Support**: Extend to Azure and GCP
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Trend analysis and capacity planning
4. **Self-Healing**: Automated disk cleanup and expansion
